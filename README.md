# candy-crush
A Simple JavaScript Game inspired by Candy Crush - Built for learning purposes only

This is a Candy Crush (Clone) game in pure JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

In this project I used simple drag and drop elements in JavaScript. This is a very popular element in building many JavaScript projects.
In addition to this,I also used inbuilt methods such as:

- addEventListener()
- setAttribute()
- setInterval()
- some()
- every()
- forEach()
- includes()
- contains()
- add()
- remove()
- createElement()
- appendChild()
- push()
- continue

And many more.

Feel free to add some more features or improve styling :)
